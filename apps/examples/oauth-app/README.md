# Lightspark React OAuth Example

This example demonstrates how to use the OAuth to authenticate via the Lightspark JS SDK. See the `src/auth` directory for the most relevant code. The LoginPage uses the `useAuth` hook to handle the OAuth flow and redirects to the DashboardPage when the user is authenticated.
