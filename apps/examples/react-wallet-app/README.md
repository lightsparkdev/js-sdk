# Lightspark React Wallet Website Example

This example demonstrates how to use the react-wallet library to initialize and authenticate a Lightspark Wallet SDK client. See the `src/auth` directory for the most relevant code. The LoginPage uses the `useJwtAuth` hook to handle the OAuth flow and redirects to the DashboardPage when the user is authenticated.

## Running the example
