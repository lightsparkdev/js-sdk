# @lightsparkdev/ls-react-native-crypto

A thin react native library for crypto operations required by the Lightspark SDKs.

## Installation

In most cases, this module shouldn't be used directly, but rather via @lightsparkdev/react-native. However, if you need to use it directly, you can install it as follows:

```
npm install @lightsparkdev/ls-react-native-crypto
```

## Example

You can see a simple example of how to use this library in the [example app](./example) or a more complex example in the [react-native module examples](../react-native/examples/ReactNativeWallet/).
