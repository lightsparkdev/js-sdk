# The Lightspark JS+TS OAuth package

This is the Lightspark Typescript Oauth package, which can be used from a browser environment. It can only be used to authenticate a Lightspark administator account, not a wallet user account. See lightspark-sdk/examples/oauth-example for an example of how to use it!

** NOTE: This package is currently in unpublished beta, and is subject to change. **

## Getting started

To use the package, you'll need to install it from npm:

```bash
$ npm install @lightsparkdev/oauth
```
