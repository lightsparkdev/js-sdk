# Node Scripts

These test scripts are meant to be run using the `ts-node` command. You can install it and other required deps by running `npm install` from this directory. Then you can run scripts! For example:

```bash
ts-node getWalletDashboard.ts
```

If you ran this without setting any environment variables, you probably got an error! The lightspark-wallet cli (@lightsparkdev/wallet-cli) can help you get things set up!

## Other scripts

Once your environment is configured, you can run other scripts in this directory using ts-node. For example:

```bash
ts-node getWalletDashboard.ts
```

Or the full example script:

```bash
ts-node example.ts
```
